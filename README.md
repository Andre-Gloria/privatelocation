# Private Location
<a href="https://github.com/wesaphzt/privatelocation" alt="GitHub Release"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/release/wesaphzt/privatelocation.svg?logo=github"></a>

A simple app to set your location to anywhere in the world, and improve general phone location privacy.

Apps on your phone can require location permissions to work, and make repeated and unnecessary location requests in the background throughout the day.

Setting your location somewhere else will help protect your privacy.

This is one of the few location apps that doesn't rely on Google Maps.

## Features
- Set phone location
- Favorite locations
- Go to location from coordinates
- Notification when location is set
- Find current location

*Note: this app, or similar apps, are unlikely to fool apps or services that have a legitimate need to determine whether users are actually where they claim to be (gaming, check-in apps etc.), and will likely deploy various anti-spoofing techniques and methods to determine if you are there or not.*

## Requirements
The app will guide you through the steps needed.

1. Developer settings will need to be enabled.

2. App will need to be set as the mock location app (or 'mock locations enabled' in older Android versions)

For better privacy, or if you're having issues with your real location being exposed, it's best to turn off any options that allow use of WiFi and network to help determine your location.

## Tips
I'm not a professional app developer, but I enjoy contributing to the open-source community in my spare time.
If you find them useful and want to support me in my mission to create privacy-oriented apps, tips are appreciated.
